# Instagram-Tech-Influencer-Analysis

This project analyzes the Instagram performance of a Tech Influencer account using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to explore engagement trends, audience growth, and content effectiveness to generate actionable insights and present them through an interactive dashboard.

🧠 Problem Statement

Tech influencers frequently post diverse content to engage their audience. However, without structured data analysis, it's challenging to understand:
- Which post types and categories drive the most engagement
- How follower growth varies over time
- What content strategy performs best on weekends vs weekdays
- When and where the highest impact is being made

This project aims to solve these problems using real Instagram engagement data.

🎯 Objectives
- Analyze post performance across different formats (Reels, Videos, Images, Carousels)
- Identify trends in follower growth and profile visits
- Evaluate quarterly and monthly engagement patterns
- Visualize all findings with a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard
- Practice SQL skills using real-world business questions
